# Differential Amplifier — Cadence Simulation

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a **basic differential amplifier** using **Cadence Virtuoso**.  
The amplifier is built using a standard differential pair to study differential-mode amplification and common-mode rejection.

## 📌 Key Highlights

- **✅ Differential Pair Design**  
  Designed a simple differential amplifier using MOSFETs without current mirror biasing, focusing on the core behavior of the differential stage.

- **✅ Biasing and Operation**  
  Used resistor biasing and a simple tail current source to provide the necessary bias current for the differential pair.

- **✅ AC Analysis**  
  Performed an AC sweep to analyze **differential gain**, **common-mode gain**, and phase response across frequencies.

- **✅ Transient Analysis**  
  Simulated input differential signals and observed the amplified output waveforms, verifying phase and gain.

- **✅ Key Metrics Observed**
  - Differential-mode gain
  
  - Phase shift over frequency
 

This project helps build a solid understanding of how a differential amplifier works, how it amplifies the difference between two signals, and how common-mode signals are rejected.
